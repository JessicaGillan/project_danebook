[A Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and SASS project from VCS](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Welcome to the Danebook! 
====
(A good old fashioned Facebook clone)

This project gave me a chance to plan and execute a project from beginning to end, backend to frontend. Including...

- Designing a relational using Entity Relationship Modeling (ERM) 
- Building the DB schema
- Setting up ActiveRecord associations
- Building out CRUD functionality for Users, Profiles, Posts, Comments, Likes, Photos, and a Session.
- Implementing authentication and authorization.
- Photo upload with Paperclip and Amazon S3
- Emails with ActionMailer, SendGrid, and DelayedJobs
- Front-end styling with Bootstrap

Create an account and watch for a welcome email.
Then use the search bar to find pre-populated users with posts/comments/etc,
or search for 'Jessica' and you can Danebook-friend me.
